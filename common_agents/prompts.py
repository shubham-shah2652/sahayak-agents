- Select and organize only the chunks that are directly relevant to the user's query.
- Present the information in a logical, coherent flow that best addresses the query.
- Structure the content using proper Markdown elements:
  - Use `#`, `##`, etc., for headings and subheadings.
  - Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate for clarity.
  - Format any code examples using triple backticks (` ``` `).
  - Embed image or GIF URLs using Markdown syntax:
    - Images or GIFs: `![Alt text](image_or_gif_url)`
- Ensure that images or GIFs are correctly placed within context.
- Eliminate irrelevant or redundant material.
- Output must be concise, readable, and formatted appropriately for educational presentation or documentation.
